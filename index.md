I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne. I am advised by Ling Ren. My research focuses on cryptography, security, and user privacy. During my internships, I have worked with amazing cryptography teams at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introducing-intel-hexl.html), and [Brave Research](https://brave.com/research/), where I designed and implemented various provably secure protocols.
