I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Ling Ren](https://sites.google.com/view/renling). My research focuses on cryptography, security, and user privacy. During my internships, I have worked with amazing cryptography teams at [Apple](https://www.apple.com), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introducing-intel-hexl.html), and [Brave Research](https://brave.com/research/), where I designed and implemented various provably secure protocols for secure data compare and access.

## Research

 I develop privacy-preserving storage protocols that use cryptography to protect user privacy. I am particularly interested in designing systems that guarantee provable privacy and security without any leakage, are concretely efficient and easy to deploy, and have realistic assumptions. Most of my recent work is based on lattice based homomorphic encryption.
